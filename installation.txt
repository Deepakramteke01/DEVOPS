PROBLEM:There is some developeres and they push their code into github. in past we have to first write all code and then we integrate all the code of developers after that we are test that integrated code.but the result of testing is failuer its is not possible for developer to solve that error(bugs) and it will take lots of time  to complete that process.that time the new methodology will came.




CONTINEOUS INTEGRATION[CI]:
it is the process that contineously integrate the code.it 





jenkins:
Root directory: /var/lib/jenkins
configuration file:/var/lib/jenkins/config.xml
jenkins port:8080
Requeriments:1-launch instance 
2:take ssh
3:install jenkins

2:wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo http://pkg.jenkins-ci.org/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
3:rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io.key
4:yum install jenkins -y
5:yum update
6:yum repolist
7:systemctl start jenkins
